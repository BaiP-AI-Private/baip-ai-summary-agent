# Twitter Scraper - Implementation Summary

## Problem Identified
The original `twitter_scraper_nitter.py` had a syntax error around line 423 with malformed exception handling and relied on unreliable Nitter instances.

## Solution Implemented
Created a new modern Twitter scraper using the Scrapfly method with Playwright to capture background requests from X.com directly.

## Files Created

### 1. `twitter_scraper_scrapfly.py` 
- Main scraper using Playwright and background request capture
- Implements the Scrapfly method for reliable data extraction
- Includes proper error handling and rate limiting
- Filters tweets to previous 24 hours
- Generates AI summaries with OpenAI

### 2. `test_setup.py`
- Test script to verify dependencies and configuration
- Checks Playwright installation and browser availability
- Validates environment variables

### 3. `setup.sh`
- Installation script for dependencies
- Instructions for Playwright browser setup

### 4. Updated `requirements.txt`
- Added playwright>=1.40.0
- Added jmespath>=1.0.1

## Key Improvements

1. **Reliability**: Uses Twitter's actual GraphQL API endpoints instead of unreliable third-party Nitter instances
2. **Data Quality**: Gets structured JSON with engagement metrics (likes, retweets, views)
3. **Modern Architecture**: Async/await with proper context management
4. **Better Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with fallback summaries
5. **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays to avoid being blocked

## Setup Instructions

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Install Playwright browsers: `playwright install chromium`
3. Test setup: `python test_setup.py`
4. Run scraper: `python twitter_scraper_scrapfly.py`

## Configuration

The scraper monitors these AI company accounts:
- OpenAI, xAI, AnthropicAI, GoogleDeepMind, MistralAI
- AIatMeta, Cohere, perplexity_ai, scale_ai, runwayml, dair_ai

Environment variables required:
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`: For posting summaries
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: For generating AI summaries (optional - has manual fallback)

## How It Works

1. Launches headless Chromium browser with Playwright
2. Navigates to each Twitter/X profile
3. Intercepts XHR requests that load tweet data  
4. Parses JSON responses using JMESPath
5. Filters tweets to previous 24 hours
6. Generates summary using OpenAI
7. Posts to Slack with formatting

The new implementation is much more robust and should provide reliable daily summaries of AI company activity on Twitter/X.
