# OpenAI Data Test Script - Multi-Method Comparison

## Purpose
This script (`test_openai_data.py`) tests multiple scraping methods and compares their results. It pulls raw, unfiltered data from OpenAI's X.com profile using different approaches and saves the results to a text file for inspection.

## Features
- **Multi-Method Testing**: Tests Playwright, Scrapfly, and Nitter methods
- **Method Comparison**: Shows which methods work and their data quality
- **No Date Filtering**: Pulls recent tweets regardless of date (typically last 7-14 days worth)
- **Detailed Metadata**: Includes engagement metrics, user info, hashtags, URLs, mentions
- **Separate Sections**: Clear breakdown showing results from each method
- **Rich Output**: Formatted text file with comprehensive analysis

## Scraping Methods Tested

### 1. **Playwright Method** (Primary)
- **Technology**: Headless browser automation
- **Approach**: Captures background XHR requests from X.com
- **Advantages**: Most reliable, gets latest data, structured JSON
- **Requirements**: `playwright` package + browser installation

### 2. **Scrapfly Method** (Advanced)
- **Technology**: Professional scraping service with anti-detection
- **Approach**: Cloud-based browser automation with proxy rotation
- **Advantages**: Superior anti-detection, residential proxies, high success rate
- **Requirements**: `scrapfly-sdk` package + API key

### 3. **Nitter Method** (Fallback)
- **Technology**: Alternative Twitter frontend scraping
- **Approach**: HTML parsing from public Nitter instances
- **Advantages**: No API requirements, lightweight
- **Requirements**: `requests` + `beautifulsoup4` packages

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
cd scripts
python test_openai_data.py
```

### Optional: Scrapfly API Key
For the Scrapfly method, add to your `.env` file:
```bash
SCRAPFLY_API_KEY=your_scrapfly_api_key_here
```
*(If not provided, Scrapfly method will be skipped)*

### What It Does
1. **Tests All Methods**: Runs Playwright, Scrapfly, and Nitter in sequence
2. **Compares Results**: Shows success/failure and tweet counts for each method
3. **Extracts Full Data**: No filtering by date or content  
4. **Saves Comparison**: Creates detailed file with separate sections per method
5. **Provides Analysis**: Summary stats and method effectiveness comparison

## Dependencies

### Required (Always)
- **Python 3.7+**
- **dotenv** - Environment variable loading
- **asyncio** - Async execution support

### Method-Specific Dependencies

#### For Playwright Method
```bash
pip install playwright jmespath
playwright install chromium
```

#### For Scrapfly Method  
```bash
pip install scrapfly-sdk
# Plus API key: SCRAPFLY_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

#### For Nitter Method
```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

```

## Output Location
Files are saved to the repository root directory:
- `../openai_scraped_data_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt`

## Use Cases

### **Method Comparison**
- **Performance Testing**: See which methods work in your environment
- **Reliability Assessment**: Compare success rates and data quality
- **Speed Analysis**: Identify fastest scraping approach

### **Data Quality Analysis**
- **Content Comparison**: See if methods return different tweet sets
- **Engagement Metrics**: Compare like/retweet counts between sources
- **Data Completeness**: Check which method provides most detailed metadata

### **Development & Debugging**
- **API Testing**: Verify scraping setup before main deployment
